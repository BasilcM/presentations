# MAX-Fashion-MNIST-WebApp

In this tutorial, we will build a Python web app to integrate the MAX-Fashion-MNIST microservice with a user-friendly interface.

**The step-wise instructions to develop the webapp for the MAX-Fashion-MNIST model are provided [here](https://github.com/CODAIT/max-fashion-mnist-tutorial-app).** Besides this README, this folder (`max-fashion-mnist-webapp-solution`) only contains the solution to the `app.py` script.
